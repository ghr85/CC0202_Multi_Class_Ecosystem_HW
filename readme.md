# Codeclan Week 02 Day 02

## Multiple Classes, Interactions & Class Diagrams

## Topics to be covered today:
* Multiple classes
* Class Interaction
* Class Diagram


## Ecosystem Homework

You are given details of an ecosystem to be created. This ecosystem contains 3 classes
which need to be created and interact with one another through their methods and attributes.


Stick to your principles:

* Take breaks or the screen will turn your eyes to fudge.
* Test first, make it fail, code it to pass, test again, commit THEN refactor
* Keep your variable names tight
* Watch the console
* Remember, you always want to test first and FAIL, this lets you know your passes are solid.

This time you'll also need to include a class diagram using UML as part of the process.

## Notes

Order of approach:

* Write it down on paper first - split it up into attributes and behaviours, understand what needs built.
* Create UML mark-up detailing class interaction
* Set up directory, spec files and source code files, create Git repository and get that first commit in.
* Get your test requirements, file requirements and headers down then draw down from MiniTest to create test class.
* Create setup data in test file to be used - create an @object of type to be tested.
* Create class in source file. Create initialize method.
* Begin creating test functions, let it fail, then code it to pass.
* Commit once passed. Keep a record, keep it clean.
