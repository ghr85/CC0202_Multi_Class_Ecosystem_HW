# Codeclan Week 02 Day 02

## Multiple Classes, Interactions & Class Diagrams

## Topics to be covered today:
* Multiple classes
* Class Interaction
* Class Diagram


## Ecosystem Homework

You are given details of an ecosystem to be created. This ecosystem contains 3 classes
which need to be created and interact with one another through their methods and attributes.
The classes defined are Bear, River and Fish - each with their own requisite attributes and functions as per MVP.


Stick to your principles:

* Take breaks or the screen will turn your eyes to fudge.
* Test first, make it fail, code it to pass, test again, commit THEN refactor
* Keep your variable names tight
* Watch the console
* Remember, you always want to test first and FAIL, this lets you know your passes are solid.

This time you'll also need to include a class diagram using UML as part of the process.

## Notes

* Splat! - The splat operator comes in handy when an unknown number of arguments is expected to be indexed in an array. This also seems to exist in Java and Javascript so presumed safe to use.
* Start with those classes which have zero dependencies then work your way up to the most.
* As you've used Require, methods for each relative class are available throughout all.


### Order of approach:

* Write it down on paper first - split it up into attributes and behaviours, understand what needs built.
* Create Class Diagram utilising UML detailing classes & interaction
* Set up directory, spec files and source code files, create Git repository and get that first commit in.
* Begin with the classes which have zero dependencies and then work your way up.
* Get your test requirements, file requirements and headers down then draw down from MiniTest to create test class.
* Create setup data in each test file to be used - create an @object of each class necessary to be tested.
* Create class in source file. Create initialize method.
* Begin creating test functions, let it fail, then code it to pass.
* Commit once passed. Keep a record, keep it clean.
